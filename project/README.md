# Project Title: Basic Machine Learning Project on FASHION-mnist Dataset

## Overview
In this project, you will build a machine learning model to classify images from the fashion MNIST dataset using prebuilt models from scikit learn and custom model using pytorch. The project will help you understand [key concepts, e.g., "data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics"].

## Objectives
- Understand and preprocess the dataset.
- Develop a neural network model for classification.
- Train and evaluate the model.
- Analyze and interpret the results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - PyTorch 
  - Scikit-learn
  - jupyterlab

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stineje/ecen4293F24
   ```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   cd ./ecen4293F24/project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project-name.ipynb
   ```
   or use VS-code built in jupyter editor

## Project Tasks
### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load the [fashion-mnist](https://openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=40996) dataset and inspect the data.
- Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalization or encoding.

### 2. Model Building
- Use Sklearn premade models for classification tasks
- Define a neural network model with at least two hidden layers.
- Choose an appropriate activation function and output layer.

### 3. Model Training
- Set up a training loop to optimize your model.
- Track and display training loss for each epoch.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate your model on the test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Generate a confusion matrix and discuss the results.

### 5. Analysis and Discussion
- Analyze the performance of your model.
- Identify any potential improvements or limitations.
