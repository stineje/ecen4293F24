I am working on a machine learning project in Python to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project involves using scikit-learn for baseline models and PyTorch to build custom neural networks, including CNNs. I am using the following libraries and functions:

- scikit-learn: 
    - sklearn.datasets
    - sklearn.linear_model
- PyTorch: 
    - torch.nn
    - torch.optim
    - torch.utils.data
    - torch.tensor

- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training loss and other metrics.
- Pandas: for viewing the data

Please guide me through understanding key concepts, like preprocessing data, training loops, and model evaluation. Provide examples of how to effectively use these functions to load data, build models, train and evaluate them, and discuss metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices. Focus on teaching me the process rather than just giving answers, and suggest ways I can improve my understanding or code.
